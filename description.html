<p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a
 reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff 
to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the 
underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosette_(zoology)" title="Rosette (zoology)">spots</a>,
 which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may
 still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member 
of the cat family that displays obvious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>.
 Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and 
backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The 
mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.
</p><p>The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some 
lions conceals an approximately 5&nbsp;mm (0.20&nbsp;in)-long, hard 
"spine" or "spur" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail 
bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth
 and develops at around <style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r1020198016">.mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}</style><span class="frac" role="math">5<span class="sr-only">+</span><span class="num">1</span>⁄<span class="den">2</span></span> months of age. It is readily identifiable by the age of seven months.<sup id="cite_ref-Schaller28_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Schaller28-51">[50]</a></sup>
</p><p>Of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight, and height at the shoulder.
 Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal 
region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly 
shorter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postorbital" class="mw-redirect" title="Postorbital">postorbital</a>
 region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the 
amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure
 of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.
</p><p>Skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represents the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.

<p>The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago.
 It starts growing when lions are about a year old. Mane colour varies 
and darkens with age; research shows its colour and size are influenced 
by environmental factors such as average ambient temperature. Mane 
length apparently signals fighting success in male–male relationships; 
darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher 
offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the 
year. The presence, absence, colour and size of the mane are associated 
with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> production; the rule of thumb is that a darker, fuller mane indicates a healthier animal. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serengeti_National_Park" title="Serengeti National Park">Serengeti National Park</a>,
 female lions favour males with dense, dark manes as mates. Male lions 
usually aim for the backs or hindquarters of rivals, rather than their 
necks.Cool ambient temperature in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane. Asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average African lions.
</p><p>Almost all male lions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendjari_National_Park" title="Pendjari National Park">Pendjari National Park</a> are either maneless or have very short manes. Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinder_National_Park" title="Dinder National Park">Dinder National Park</a> and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_East_National_Park" title="Tsavo East National Park">Tsavo East National Park</a>, Kenya. The original male white lion from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbavati" class="mw-redirect" title="Timbavati">Timbavati</a> in South Africa was also maneless. The hormone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> has been linked to mane growth; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration" title="Castration">castrated</a> lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonad" title="Gonad">gonads</a> inhibits testosterone production. Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.

<p>The white lion is a rare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)" title="Polymorphism (biology)">morph</a> with a genetic condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucism" title="Leucism">leucism</a> which is caused by a double <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessive_allele" class="mw-redirect" title="Recessive allele">recessive allele</a>.
 It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. 
White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruger_National_Park" title="Kruger National Park">Kruger National Park</a> and the adjacent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbavati_Private_Game_Reserve" class="mw-redirect" title="Timbavati Private Game Reserve">Timbavati Private Game Reserve</a> in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_pool" title="Gene pool">gene pool</a>. Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015. White lions are selected for breeding in captivity. They have reportedly been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canned_hunt" title="Canned hunt">canned hunts</a>.

<div class="fig_caption">Lion in Gir National Park</div>

<p>African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers grassy plains and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah" class="mw-redirect" title="Savannah">savannahs</a>, scrub bordering rivers and open woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests. On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elgon" title="Mount Elgon">Mount Elgon</a>, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600&nbsp;m (11,800&nbsp;ft) and close to the snow line on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kenya" title="Mount Kenya">Mount Kenya</a>.
 Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to 1,500&nbsp;mm (12 to 
59&nbsp;in) make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at
 3,390,821&nbsp;km (1,309,203&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) at most; but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afromontane" title="Afromontane">montane</a> forests in East Africa. The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gir_National_Park" title="Gir National Park">Gir National Park</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrub_forest" class="mw-redirect" title="Scrub forest">scrub forest</a>. 
</p>
<h3>Historical range</h3>
<p>In Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_rainforest" class="mw-redirect" title="African rainforest">African rainforest</a> zone and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> desert. In the 1960s, it became extinct in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, except in the southern part of Sudan.
</p><p>In southern Europe and Asia, the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey. In Greece, it was common as reported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> in 480 BC; it was considered rare by 300 BC and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">extirpated</a> by AD 100. It was present in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> until the 10th century. It lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a> until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and in Southwest Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of Turkey.The last live lion in Iran was sighted in 1942 about 65&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) northwest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dezful" title="Dezful">Dezful</a>, although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karun" title="Karun">Karun</a> river in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh%C5%ABzest%C4%81n_Province" class="mw-redirect" title="Khūzestān Province">Khūzestān Province</a> in 1944. It once ranged from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sind" class="mw-redirect" title="Sind">Sind</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab" title="Punjab">Punjab</a> in Pakistan to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal" title="Bengal">Bengal</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmada_River" title="Narmada River">Narmada River</a> in central India.
