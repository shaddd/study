<h2>Conservation</h2><hr/>
The lion is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I and the African population on CITES Appendix II.[2]
<h3>In Africa</h3>

<p>Several large and well-managed protected areas in Africa host large 
lion populations. Where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been 
developed, cash revenue for park management and local communities is a 
strong incentive for lion conservation.
 Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa; their numbers are 
rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% in the late half of 
the 20th century. Primary causes of the decline include disease and 
human interference. In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004.
</p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Republic of the Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odzala-Kokoua_National_Park" title="Odzala-Kokoua National Park">Odzala-Kokoua National Park</a>
 was considered a lion stronghold in the 1990s. By 2014, no lions were 
recorded in the protected area so the population is considered locally 
extinct.
 The West African lion population is isolated from the one in Central 
Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it 
was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, 
including fewer than 250 mature individuals. They persist in three 
protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_National_Park" title="W National Park">W</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arli_National_Park" title="Arli National Park">A</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendjari_National_Park" title="Pendjari National Park">P</a> protected area complex, shared by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin" title="Benin">Benin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger" title="Niger">Niger</a>. This population is listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered" title="Critically Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>. Field surveys in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W-Arly-Pendjari_Complex" title="W-Arly-Pendjari Complex">WAP ecosystem</a>
 revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W National Park, and 
higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.
</p><p>A population occurs in Cameroon's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waza_National_Park" title="Waza National Park">Waza National Park</a>, where between approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009. In addition, 50 to 150 lions are estimated to be present in Burkina Faso's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arly-Singou" title="Arly-Singou">Arly-Singou</a> ecosystem.In 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in Ghana's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_National_Park" title="Mole National Park">Mole National Park</a>. These were the first sightings of lions in the country in 39 years.In the same year, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">extirpated</a> was filmed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alatash_National_Park" class="mw-redirect" title="Alatash National Park">Alatash National Park</a>, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border.
</p><p>In 2005, Lion Conservation Strategies were developed for West and
 Central Africa, and or East and Southern Africa. The strategies seek to
 maintain suitable habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for 
lions, reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations,
 and make lion–human coexistence sustainable.
Lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced in areas where 
herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. Such measures contribute 
to mitigating human–lion conflict.

<div class="fig_caption">A lioness in Gir National Park</div>

<p>The last refuge of the Asiatic lion population is the 1,412&nbsp;km (545&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) Gir National Park and surrounding areas in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurashtra_(region)" title="Saurashtra (region)">region of Saurashtra</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathiawar_Peninsula" class="mw-redirect" title="Kathiawar Peninsula">Kathiawar Peninsula</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> State, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>. The population has risen from approximately 180 lions in 1974 to about 400 in 2010. It is geographically isolated, which can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding" title="Inbreeding">inbreeding</a> and reduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity" title="Genetic diversity">genetic diversity</a>. Since 2008, the Asiatic lion has been listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered" class="mw-redirect" title="Endangered">Endangered</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a>.By 2015, the population had grown to 523 individuals inhabiting an area of 7,000&nbsp;km (2,700&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in Saurashtra. The Asiatic Lion Census conducted in 2017 recorded about 650 individuals.
</p><p>The presence of numerous human habitations close to the National 
Park results in conflict between lions, local people and their 
livestock. Some consider the presence of lions a benefit, as they keep populations of crop damaging herbivores in check. The establishment of a second, independent Asiatic lion population in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuno_Wildlife_Sanctuary" class="mw-redirect" title="Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary">Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary</a>, located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh" title="Madhya Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> was planned but in 2017, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_Lion_Reintroduction_Project" title="Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project">Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project</a> seemed unlikely to be implemented.

<h3>Captive breeding</h3>

<div class="fig_caption">Two captive male Asiatic lions in Sanjay Gandhi National Park, India</div>

<p>Lions imported to Europe before the middle of the 19th century were 
possibly foremost Barbary lions from North Africa, or Cape lions from 
Southern Africa.
Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa_Zoo" title="Addis Ababa Zoo">Addis Ababa Zoo</a> are descendants of animals owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie_I_of_Ethiopia" class="mw-redirect" title="Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia">Emperor Haile Selassie</a>. WildLink International in collaboration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University" class="mw-redirect" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a> launched an ambitious International <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_lion#The_Barbary_Lion_Project" title="Barbary lion">Barbary Lion Project</a> with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Mountains" title="Atlas Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a> of Morocco.
 However, a genetic analysis showed that the captive lions at Addis 
Ababa Zoo were not Barbary lions, but rather closely related to wild 
lions in Chad and Cameroon.</p><p>In 1982, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums" title="Association of Zoos and Aquariums">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> started a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Survival_Plan" title="Species Survival Plan">Species Survival Plan</a>
 for the Asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. In 1987, it 
was found that most lions in North American zoos were hybrids between 
African and Asiatic lions.
Breeding programs need to note origins of the participating animals to 
avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their 
conservation value.
Captive breeding of lions was halted to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_(animal)" class="mw-redirect" title="Pedigree (animal)">pedigree</a>.
 Wild-born lions were imported to American zoos from Africa between 1989
 and 1995. Breeding was continued in 1998 in the frame of an African 
lion Species Survival Plan.
</p><p>About 77% of the captive lions registered in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Species_Information_System" class="mw-redirect" title="International Species Information System">International Species Information System</a>
 in 2006 were of unknown origin; these animals might have carried genes 
that are extinct in the wild and may therefore be important to the 
maintenance of the overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variability" title="Genetic variability">genetic variability</a> of the lion.

<p>Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to
 zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are
 more selective about their exhibits,
 there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and 
wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador 
species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can live over twenty years in captivity; a lion in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_Zoo" title="Honolulu Zoo">Honolulu Zoo</a> died at the age of 22 in August 2007.His two sisters, born in 1986, also reached the age of 22.
</p><p>The first European "zoos" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seraglio" title="Seraglio">seraglios</a>; at that time they came to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menagerie" title="Menagerie">menageries</a>, an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities" title="Cabinet of curiosities">cabinet of curiosities</a>. They spread from France and Italy during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> to the rest of Europe. In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London#Menagerie" title="Tower of London">kept at the Tower of London</a> in a seraglio established by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_England" class="mw-redirect" title="John of England">King John</a> in the 13th century; this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_England" title="Henry I of England">Henry I</a> at his hunting lodge in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Oxfordshire" title="Woodstock, Oxfordshire">Woodstock, Oxfordshire</a>, where according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury" title="William of Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> lions had been stocked.
</p><p>Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoo" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a> until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s. Further changes took place in the early 20th century when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Hagenbeck" title="Carl Hagenbeck">Carl Hagenbeck</a>
 designed enclosures with concrete "rocks", more open space and a moat 
instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck 
designed lion enclosures for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Zoo" title="Melbourne Zoo">Melbourne Zoo</a> and Sydney's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taronga_Zoo" title="Taronga Zoo">Taronga Zoo</a>; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s.
 In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use 
of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors
 to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the 
Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Zoo_and_Botanical_Garden" title="Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden">Oklahoma City Zoological Park</a> placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_taming" title="Lion taming">Lion taming</a> has been part of both established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus" title="Circus">circuses</a> and individual acts such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_%26_Roy" title="Siegfried &amp; Roy">Siegfried &amp; Roy</a>. The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_A._Van_Amburgh" title="Isaac A. Van Amburgh">Isaac Van Amburgh</a>, who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.Van Amburgh performed before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime" title="Pantomime">pantomime</a> titled <i>Les Lions de Mysore</i> ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism" title="Equestrianism">equestrianism</a>
 acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public 
consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. In demonstrating 
the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose 
similar to animal fights of previous centuries.
 The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is 
demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth. The
 now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Beatty" title="Clyde Beatty">Clyde Beatty</a> (1903–1965).

<div class="fig_caption">Bas-relief of a wounded lioness from Nineveh, c. 645–635 BC</div>

<p>Lion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal 
pastime; intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. The 
earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_III" title="Amenhotep III">Amenhotep&nbsp;III</a> killing 102 lions "with his own arrows" during the first ten years of his rule. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria" title="Assyria">Assyrians</a>
 would release captive lions in a reserved space for the king to hunt; 
this event would be watched by spectators as the king and his men, on 
horseback or chariots, killed the lions with arrows and spears. Lions 
were also hunted during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" title="Mughal Empire">Mughal Empire</a>, where Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir" title="Jahangir">Jahangir</a> is said to have excelled at it. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Rome</a>, lions were kept by emperors for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venatio" title="Venatio">hunts</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestiarii" class="mw-redirect" title="Bestiarii">gladiator fights</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_ad_bestias" title="Damnatio ad bestias">executions</a>.
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_people" title="Maasai people">Maasai people</a>
 have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. 
Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced 
lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa" title="Scramble for Africa">European colonisation of Africa</a> in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered as vermin and lion hides fetched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">£1</a> each. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_hunting" title="Trophy hunting">Trophy hunting</a> of lions in recent years has been met with controversy; notably with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Cecil_the_lion" title="Killing of Cecil the lion">killing of Cecil the lion</a> in mid-2015.

<h3>Man-eating</h3>

<div class="fig_caption">The Tsavo maneaters of East Africa on display in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago</div>

<p>Lions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them out. One well-publicised case is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_maneaters" class="mw-redirect" title="Tsavo maneaters">Tsavo maneaters</a>; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Railway" title="Uganda Railway">Kenya-Uganda Railway</a> were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge in Kenya.
 The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' 
predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and 
one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including 
tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth 
and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while 
tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in 
human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on 
humans. Sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.
</p><p>Lions' proclivity for man-eating has been systematically 
examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating 
behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 
2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this 
period. The incidents occurred near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selous_Game_Reserve" title="Selous Game Reserve">Selous National Park</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufiji_River" title="Rufiji River">Rufiji District</a> and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindi_Region" title="Lindi Region">Lindi Province</a>
 near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villages into bush 
country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must 
mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes 
directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which lions seize humans 
from the centres of substantial villages have been documented. Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon" title="Full moon">full moon</a>, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.
</p><p>According to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly 
crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and 
eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. 
Frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>
 sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. For 
nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly
 crossed the park in daytime with little harm.

<p>The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human
 culture. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, 
on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.
 It appeared as a symbol for strength and nobility in cultures across 
Europe, Asia and Africa, despite incidents of attacks on people. The 
lion has been depicted as "king of the jungle" and "king of beasts", and
 thus became a popular symbol for royalty and stateliness. The lion is also used as a symbol of sporting teams.

<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, the lion has been a common character in stories, proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts. In some cultures, the lion symbolises power and royalty. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili language</a>, the lion is known as <i>simba</i> which also means "aggressive", "king" and "strong". Some rulers had the word "lion" in their nickname. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundiata_Keita" title="Sundiata Keita">Sundiata Keita</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Empire" title="Mali Empire">Mali Empire</a> was called "Lion of Mali". The founder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waalo" title="Waalo">Waalo</a>
 kingdom is said to have been raised by lions and returned to his people
 part-lion to unite them using the knowledge he learned from the lions.
</p><p>In parts of West Africa, lions symbolised the top class of their social hierarchies. In more heavily forested areas where lions were rare, the leopard represented the top of the hierarchy. In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and is regarded as the link between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairvoyance" title="Clairvoyance">seers</a> and the supernatural.
