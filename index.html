<p>The <b>lion</b> (<i>Panthera leo</i>) is a large <a href="/wiki/Felidae" title="Felidae">cat</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Panthera" title="Panthera">Panthera</a></i> native to <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is <a href="/wiki/Sexually_dimorphic" class="mw-redirect" title="Sexually dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.  It is a <a href="/wiki/Social_species" class="mw-redirect" title="Social species">social species</a>, forming groups called <i>prides</i>. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large <a href="/wiki/Ungulate" title="Ungulate">ungulates</a>. The lion is an <a href="/wiki/Apex_predator" title="Apex predator">apex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Keystone_predator" class="mw-redirect" title="Keystone predator">keystone predator</a>; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
</p>
<p>The lion inhabits <a href="/wiki/Grassland" title="Grassland">grasslands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savannas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shrubland" title="Shrubland">shrublands</a>. It is usually more <a href="/wiki/Diurnality" title="Diurnality">diurnal</a> than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active <a href="/wiki/Nocturnality" title="Nocturnality">at night</a> and <a href="/wiki/Crepuscular" class="mw-redirect" title="Crepuscular">at twilight</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Europe" title="Southeast Europe">Southeast Europe</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Western_Asia" title="Western Asia">Western</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a>, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and one population in <a href="/wiki/Western_India" title="Western India">western India</a>. It has been listed as <a href="/wiki/Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species">Vulnerable</a> on the <a href="/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">IUCN Red List</a> since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, <a href="/wiki/Habitat_loss" class="mw-redirect" title="Habitat loss">habitat loss</a> and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
</p>
<p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in <a href="/wiki/Menagerie" title="Menagerie">menageries</a> since the time of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> and have been a key species sought for exhibition in <a href="/wiki/Zoological_garden" class="mw-redirect" title="Zoological garden">zoological gardens</a> across the world since the late 18th century. <a href="/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_lions" title="Cultural depictions of lions">Cultural depictions of lions</a> were prominent in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.

<p>However, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups
 in northern Central Africa. DNA analysis from a more recent study 
indicates, that Central African lions are derived from both northern and
 southern lions, as they cluster with <i>P. leo leo</i> in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas their genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. <i>leo melanochaita</i>.
</p><p>Lion samples from some parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Highlands" title="Ethiopian Highlands">Ethiopian Highlands</a>
 cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from
 other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. 
Researchers therefore assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two 
subspecies.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">Genome</a>-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with <i>P. l. leo</i> in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to <i>P. l. melanochaita</i>. This result suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision.

The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palearctic" class="mw-redirect" title="Palearctic">Palearctic</a> since at least the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>.

</p><p>Estimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_rate" title="Mutation rate">mutation rate</a> per generation time of the modern lion. There is no evidence for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow" title="Gene flow">gene flow</a> between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area.The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period" class="mw-redirect" title="Last glacial period">last glacial period</a> without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion" title="Mitochondrion">mitochondrial</a> descendants on other continents. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Pleistocene" class="mw-redirect" title="Middle Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a>
 and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late 
Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became 
separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial 
rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago.<sup id="cite_ref-Barnett_al2014_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barnett_al2014-42">[41]</a></sup>
They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago.<sup id="cite_ref-DeManuel_al2020_23-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeManuel_al2020-23">[22]</a></sup>
Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, 
lion populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the 
rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions 
moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to 
southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.<sup id="cite_ref-Barnett_al2014_42-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Barnett_al2014-42">[41]</a></sup>
</p><p>Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the 
Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and 
Africa. Genetic evidence revealed numerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutations</a>
 in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that 
this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less 
diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa.<sup id="cite_ref-Bertola2011_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bertola2011-43">[42]</a></sup>
A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from West Africa shared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleles" class="mw-redirect" title="Alleles">alleles</a>

A tuft at the end of the tail is a distinct characteristic of the lion.
Skeleton

<p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a
 reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff 
to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the 
underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosette_(zoology)" title="Rosette (zoology)">spots</a>,
 which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may
 still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member 
of the cat family that displays obvious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>.
 Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and 
backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The 
mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.
</p><p>The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some 
lions conceals an approximately 5&nbsp;mm (0.20&nbsp;in)-long, hard 
"spine" or "spur" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail 
bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth
 and develops at around <style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r1020198016">.mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}</style><span class="frac" role="math">5<span class="sr-only">+</span><span class="num">1</span>⁄<span class="den">2</span></span> months of age. It is readily identifiable by the age of seven months.<sup id="cite_ref-Schaller28_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Schaller28-51">[50]</a></sup>
</p><p>Of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight, and height at the shoulder.
 Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal 
region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly 
shorter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postorbital" class="mw-redirect" title="Postorbital">postorbital</a>
 region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the 
amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure
 of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.
</p><p>Skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represents the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.

<p>The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago.
 It starts growing when lions are about a year old. Mane colour varies 
and darkens with age; research shows its colour and size are influenced 
by environmental factors such as average ambient temperature. Mane 
length apparently signals fighting success in male–male relationships; 
darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher 
offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the 
year. The presence, absence, colour and size of the mane are associated 
with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> production; the rule of thumb is that a darker, fuller mane indicates a healthier animal. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serengeti_National_Park" title="Serengeti National Park">Serengeti National Park</a>,
 female lions favour males with dense, dark manes as mates. Male lions 
usually aim for the backs or hindquarters of rivals, rather than their 
necks.Cool ambient temperature in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane. Asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average African lions.
</p><p>Almost all male lions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendjari_National_Park" title="Pendjari National Park">Pendjari National Park</a> are either maneless or have very short manes. Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinder_National_Park" title="Dinder National Park">Dinder National Park</a> and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_East_National_Park" title="Tsavo East National Park">Tsavo East National Park</a>, Kenya. The original male white lion from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbavati" class="mw-redirect" title="Timbavati">Timbavati</a> in South Africa was also maneless. The hormone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> has been linked to mane growth; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration" title="Castration">castrated</a> lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonad" title="Gonad">gonads</a> inhibits testosterone production. Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.

Lion in Gir National Park

<p>African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers grassy plains and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah" class="mw-redirect" title="Savannah">savannahs</a>, scrub bordering rivers and open woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests. On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elgon" title="Mount Elgon">Mount Elgon</a>, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600&nbsp;m (11,800&nbsp;ft) and close to the snow line on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kenya" title="Mount Kenya">Mount Kenya</a>.
 Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to 1,500&nbsp;mm (12 to 
59&nbsp;in) make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at
 3,390,821&nbsp;km (1,309,203&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) at most; but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afromontane" title="Afromontane">montane</a> forests in East Africa. The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gir_National_Park" title="Gir National Park">Gir National Park</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrub_forest" class="mw-redirect" title="Scrub forest">scrub forest</a>. 
</p>
<h3>Historical range</h3>
<p>In Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_rainforest" class="mw-redirect" title="African rainforest">African rainforest</a> zone and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> desert. In the 1960s, it became extinct in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, except in the southern part of Sudan.
</p><p>In southern Europe and Asia, the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey. In Greece, it was common as reported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> in 480 BC; it was considered rare by 300 BC and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">extirpated</a> by AD 100. It was present in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> until the 10th century. It lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a> until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and in Southwest Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of Turkey.The last live lion in Iran was sighted in 1942 about 65&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) northwest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dezful" title="Dezful">Dezful</a>, although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karun" title="Karun">Karun</a> river in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh%C5%ABzest%C4%81n_Province" class="mw-redirect" title="Khūzestān Province">Khūzestān Province</a> in 1944.

</p>
<h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
<p>Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day.
 Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally 
peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. 
Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most 
often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 
fifty minutes eating.

<br>A lioness (left) and two males in Masai Mara


<p>The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in 
groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is 
called a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animal_names#L" title="List of animal names">pride</a>". Groups of male lions are called "coalitions". Females form the stable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_unit" class="mw-redirect" title="Social unit">social unit</a> in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership changes only with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females leave and become nomadic.
 The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult 
females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides,
 consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed. The sole exception to this pattern is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_lion" class="mw-redirect" title="Tsavo lion">Tsavo lion</a> pride that always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age.
</p><p>Some lions are "nomads" that range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone.
 Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from
 their birth pride. A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become 
residents and vice versa.Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrus" class="mw-redirect" title="Estrus">estrus</a> allow nomadic males to approach them. Males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride.
 A study undertaken in the Serengeti National Park revealed that nomadic
 coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age. In Kruger National Park, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_dispersal" title="Biological dispersal">dispersing</a>
 male lions move more than 25&nbsp;km (16&nbsp;mi) away from their natal
 pride in search of their own territory. Female lions stay closer to 
their natal pride. Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely 
related to each other than male lions in the same area.
</p><p>The area occupied by a pride is called a "pride area" whereas that occupied by a nomad is a "range". Males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)">territory</a>. The reasons for the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior" title="Social behavior">sociality</a>
 in lionesses—the most pronounced in any cat species—are the subject of 
much debate. Increased hunting success appears to be an obvious reason, 
but this is uncertain upon examination; coordinated hunting allows for 
more successful predation but also ensures non-hunting members reduce <i>per capita</i>
 calorific intake. Some females, however, take a role raising cubs that 
may be left alone for extended periods. Members of the pride tend to 
regularly play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health 
of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride; 
hunters are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other
 benefits include possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection" title="Kin selection">kin selection</a>;
 sharing food within the family; protecting the young, maintaining 
territory and individual insurance against injury and hunger.
</p><p>Both males and females defend the pride against intruders, but 
the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, 
more powerful build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence 
against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable services to the group.
 Alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a leader that
 fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in
 these responses.
 The male or males associated with the pride must defend their 
relationship with the pride from outside males who may attempt to usurp 
them.</p><p>Asiatic lion prides differ in group composition. Male Asiatic 
lions are solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose 
pride while females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a 
stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male lions associate
 only when mating.
 Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions.
 Males in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced 
hierarchy, in which one male dominates the others and mates more 
frequently.

Lions also hunt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_warthog" title="Common warthog">common warthog</a> depending on availability, although the species is below the preferred weight range. In India, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambar_deer" title="Sambar deer">sambar deer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chital" title="Chital">chital</a> are the most commonly recorded wild prey, while domestic livestock may contribute significantly to their diet. They usually avoid fully grown adult <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant" title="Elephant">elephants</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros" title="Rhinoceros">rhinoceroses</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> and small prey like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dik-dik" title="Dik-dik">dik-dik</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrax" title="Hyrax">hyrax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare" title="Hare">hare</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey" title="Monkey">monkey</a>. Unusual prey include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_porcupine" title="Old World porcupine">porcupines</a> and small reptiles. Lions kill other predators such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard" title="Leopard">leopard</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah" title="Cheetah">cheetah</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena">spotted hyena</a> but seldom consume them.
</p><p>Young lions first display stalking behaviour at around three 
months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they 
are almost a year old and begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age
 of two. Single lions are capable of bringing down zebra and wildebeest, while larger prey like buffalo and giraffe are riskier.
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chobe_National_Park" title="Chobe National Park">Chobe National Park</a>, large prides have been observed hunting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant" title="African bush elephant">African bush elephants</a> up to around 15 years old in exceptional cases, with the victims being calves, juveniles, and even subadults.
 In typical hunts, each lioness has a favoured position in the group, 
either stalking prey on the "wing", then attacking, or moving a smaller 
distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey fleeing from 
other lionesses. Males attached to prides do not usually participate in 
group hunting.
 Some evidence suggests, however, that males are just as successful as 
females; they are typically solo hunters who ambush prey in small 
bushland.
</p><p>Lions are not particularly known for their stamina; for instance,
 a lioness' heart comprises only 0.57% of her body weight and a male's 
is about 0.45% of his body weight, whereas a hyena's heart comprises 
almost 1% of its body weight.Thus, lions run quickly only in short bursts
 and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They 
take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place 
near some form of cover or at night.
 The lion's attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch prey 
with a fast rush and final leap. They usually pull it down by the rump 
and kill by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat_clamp" title="Throat clamp">strangling bite to the throat</a>. They also kill prey by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_clamp" title="Muzzle clamp">enclosing its mouth and nostrils in their jaws</a>.
</p><p>Lions typically consume prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes drag large prey into cover.
 They tend to squabble over kills, particularly the males. Cubs suffer 
most when food is scarce but otherwise all pride members eat their fill,
 including old and crippled lions, which can live on leftovers. Large kills are shared more widely among pride members.
 An adult lioness requires an average of about 5&nbsp;kg (11&nbsp;lb) of
 meat per day while males require about 7&nbsp;kg (15&nbsp;lb). Lions gorge themselves and eat up to 30&nbsp;kg (66&nbsp;lb) in one session;
 if it is unable to consume all of the kill, it rests for a few hours 
before continuing to eat. On hot days, the pride retreats to shade with 
one or two males standing guard.Lions defend their kills from scavengers such as vultures and hyenas.
</p><p>Lions scavenge on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion" title="Carrion">carrion</a>
 when the opportunity arises; they scavenge animals dead from natural 
causes such as disease or those that were killed by other predators. 
Scavenging lions keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, which 
indicate the death or distress of an animal. Most carrion on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by hyenas rather than lions.Carrion is thought to provide a large part of lion diet.

Lioness stealing a kill from a leopard in Kruger National Park

<p>Lions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and where 
they coexist they compete for prey and carrion; a review of data across 
several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%.
 Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas unless the lions are on a kill or
 are being harassed by the hyenas, while the latter tend to visibly 
react to the presence of lions, with or without the presence of food. 
Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas; in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngorongoro_crater" class="mw-redirect" title="Ngorongoro crater">Ngorongoro crater</a> it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate.
 In Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed; hyenas 
frequently challenge lions and steal their kills, obtaining food from 
63% of all lion kills.
 When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or 
wait patiently at a distance of 30–100&nbsp;m (100–330&nbsp;ft) until 
the lions have finished. 
</p><p>Hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions and to force the 
lions off a kill. The two species attack one another even when there is 
no food involved for no apparent reason. Lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etosha_National_Park" title="Etosha National Park">Etosha National Park</a>. Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories. When the lion population in Kenya's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masai_Mara_National_Reserve" class="mw-redirect" title="Masai Mara National Reserve">Masai Mara National Reserve</a> declined, the spotted hyena population increased rapidly.
 Experiments on captive spotted hyenas show that specimens without prior
 experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will 
react fearfully to lion scent.
</p><p>Lions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, steal their kills and kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance.Cheetahs in particular often lose their kills to lions or other predators. A study in the Serengeti ecosystem revealed that lions killed at least 17 of 125 cheetah cubs born between 1987 and 1990. Cheetahs avoid their competitors by using different temporal and habitat niches.
 Leopards are able to take refuge in trees; lionesses, however, 
occasionally attempt to climb up and retrieve leopard kills from that 
height. 
</p><p>Lions similarly dominate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_dog" title="African wild dog">African wild dogs</a>,
 taking their kills and preying on young and rarely adult dogs. 
Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more 
abundant. However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs. Lions also charge at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile" title="Nile crocodile">Nile crocodiles</a>;
 depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either animal can 
lose their kills to the other. Lions have been observed killing 
crocodiles that ventured onto land. Crocodiles may also kill and eat lions, evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.

<p>Most lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyestrous" class="mw-redirect" title="Polyestrous">polyestrous</a>. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_penis" class="mw-redirect" title="Cat's penis">those of other cats</a>, the male lion's penis has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_spines" title="Penile spines">spines that point backward</a>. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation" title="Ovulation">ovulation</a>. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrous_cycle" title="Estrous cycle">in heat</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_time" title="Generation time">Generation length</a> of the lion is about seven years. The average gestation period is around 110<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>days;
 the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a 
secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other 
sheltered area, usually away from the pride. She will often hunt alone 
while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den.
 Lion cubs are born blind; their eyes open around seven days after 
birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1&nbsp;kg (2.6–4.6&nbsp;lb) at birth and are 
almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking
 around three weeks of age.
 To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the 
lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying
 them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.
</p><p>Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old.
 Sometimes the introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly 
if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time.
 When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack 
confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They 
soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing 
among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults.
 Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of 
another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of 
the cubs varies—one male could patiently let the cubs play with his tail
 or his mane, while another may snarl and bat the cubs away.

Video of a lioness and her cubs in Phinda Reserve

<p>Pride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and 
communal rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle 
indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. 
The synchronisation of births is advantageous because the cubs grow to 
being roughly the same size and have an equal chance of survival, and 
sucklings are not dominated by older cubs.
 Weaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at 
about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of 
challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. 
They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the 
latest.
</p><p>When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide_(zoology)" title="Infanticide (zoology)">kill any existing young cubs</a>,
 perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their
 cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a 
usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four 
mothers within a pride join forces against the male. Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two.
 Both male and female lions may be ousted from prides to become nomads, 
although most females usually remain with their birth pride. When a 
pride becomes too large, however, the youngest generation of female cubs
 may be forced to leave to find their own territory. When a new male 
lion takes over a pride, adolescents both male and female may be 
evicted. Lions of both sexes may be involved in group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_animals" class="mw-redirect" title="Homosexuality in animals">homosexual</a> and courtship activities; males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before simulating sex together.

<p>Although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans or other lions.
 Lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other prides they 
encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride when 
fighting at a kill.
 Crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to hyenas and leopards or be 
trampled by buffalo or elephants. Careless lions may be maimed when 
hunting prey.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick" title="Tick">Ticks</a> commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of lions. Adult forms of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapeworm" class="mw-redirect" title="Tapeworm">tapeworm</a> species of the genus <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_(tapeworm)" title="Taenia (tapeworm)">Taenia</a></i> have been isolated from lion intestines, having been ingested as larvae in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope" title="Antelope">antelope</a> meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_fly" title="Stable fly">Stomoxys calcitrans</a></i>)
 in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming emaciated and covered in 
bloody, bare patches. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting 
flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many died or 
migrated and the local population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions.
</p><p>Captive lions have been infected with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper" title="Canine distemper">canine distemper</a> virus (CDV) since at least the mid 1970s.
 CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in
 Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological 
symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis" title="Encephalitis">encephalitis</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus" title="Feline immunodeficiency virus">Feline immunodeficiency virus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus" title="Lentivirus">lentivirus</a> also affect captive lions.

Head rubbing among pride members is a common social behaviour

<p>When resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of 
behaviours; the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The 
most common peaceful, tactile gestures are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunting_(animal_behavior)" title="Bunting (animal behavior)">head rubbing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_licking" class="mw-redirect" title="Social licking">social licking</a>, which have been compared with the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allogrooming" class="mw-redirect" title="Allogrooming">allogrooming</a> among primates. Head rubbing—nuzzling the forehead, face and neck against another lion—appears to be a form of greeting
 and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others or after a
 fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and 
females rub females.
 Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is 
generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head
 and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour 
may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas 
themselves.

Problems playing this file? See media help.

<p>Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures. A common facial expression is the "grimace face" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehmen_response" title="Flehmen response">flehmen response</a>,
 which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open 
mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose closed eyes and 
relaxed ears. Lions also use chemical and visual marking; males will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)#Scent_marking" title="Territory (animal)">spray</a> and scrape plots of ground and objects within the territory.
</p><p>The lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in 
intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion 
vocalisations are variations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growling" title="Growling">growling</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snarling" class="mw-redirect" title="Snarling">snarling</a>, meowing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring" class="mw-redirect" title="Roaring">roaring</a>.
 Other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating and humming. 
Roaring is used to advertise its presence. Lions most often roar at 
night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 kilometres 
(5&nbsp;mi).
 They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few 
deep, long roars that subside into a series of shorter ones.

<h2>Conservation</h2>
The lion is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I and the African population on CITES Appendix II.[2]

Video of a wild lioness

<p>Several large and well-managed protected areas in Africa host large 
lion populations. Where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been 
developed, cash revenue for park management and local communities is a 
strong incentive for lion conservation.
 Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa; their numbers are 
rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% in the late half of 
the 20th century. Primary causes of the decline include disease and 
human interference. In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004.
</p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo" title="Republic of the Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odzala-Kokoua_National_Park" title="Odzala-Kokoua National Park">Odzala-Kokoua National Park</a>
 was considered a lion stronghold in the 1990s. By 2014, no lions were 
recorded in the protected area so the population is considered locally 
extinct.
 The West African lion population is isolated from the one in Central 
Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it 
was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, 
including fewer than 250 mature individuals. They persist in three 
protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_National_Park" title="W National Park">W</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arli_National_Park" title="Arli National Park">A</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendjari_National_Park" title="Pendjari National Park">P</a> protected area complex, shared by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin" title="Benin">Benin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger" title="Niger">Niger</a>. This population is listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered" title="Critically Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>. Field surveys in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W-Arly-Pendjari_Complex" title="W-Arly-Pendjari Complex">WAP ecosystem</a>
 revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W National Park, and 
higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.
</p><p>A population occurs in Cameroon's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waza_National_Park" title="Waza National Park">Waza National Park</a>, where between approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009. In addition, 50 to 150 lions are estimated to be present in Burkina Faso's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arly-Singou" title="Arly-Singou">Arly-Singou</a> ecosystem.In 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in Ghana's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_National_Park" title="Mole National Park">Mole National Park</a>. These were the first sightings of lions in the country in 39 years.In the same year, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction" title="Local extinction">extirpated</a> was filmed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alatash_National_Park" class="mw-redirect" title="Alatash National Park">Alatash National Park</a>, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border.

 Central Africa, and or East and Southern Africa. The strategies seek to
 maintain suitable habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for 
lions, reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations,
 and make lion–human coexistence sustainable.
Lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced in areas where 
herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. Such measures contribute 
to mitigating human–lion conflict.

<p>Lions imported to Europe before the middle of the 19th century were

Southern Africa.
Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa_Zoo" title="Addis Ababa Zoo">Addis Ababa Zoo</a> are descendants of animals owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie_I_of_Ethiopia" class="mw-redirect" title="Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia">Emperor Haile Selassie</a>.

 However, a genetic analysis showed that the captive lions at Addis 
Ababa Zoo were not Barbary lions, but rather closely related to wild 
lions in Chad and Cameroon.</p><p>In 1982, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums" title="Association of Zoos and Aquariums">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> started a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Survival_Plan" title="Species Survival Plan">Species Survival Plan</a>
 for the Asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. In 1987, it 
was found that most lions in North American zoos were hybrids between 
African and Asiatic lions.
Breeding programs need to note origins of the participating animals to 
avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their 
conservation value.
Captive breeding of lions was halted to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_(animal)" class="mw-redirect" title="Pedigree (animal)">pedigree</a>.
 Wild-born lions were imported to American zoos from Africa between 1989

<p>Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to
 zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are
 more selective about their exhibits,
 there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and 
wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador 
species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can live over twenty years in captivity; a lion in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_Zoo" title="Honolulu Zoo">Honolulu Zoo</a> died at the age of 22 in August 2007.His two sisters, born in 1986, also reached the age of 22.
</p><p>The first European "zoos" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seraglio" title="Seraglio">seraglios</a>; at that time they came to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menagerie" title="Menagerie">menageries</a>, an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities" title="Cabinet of curiosities">cabinet of curiosities</a>. They spread from France and Italy during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> to the rest of Europe. In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London#Menagerie" title="Tower of London">kept at the Tower of London</a> in a seraglio established by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_England" class="mw-redirect" title="John of England">King John</a> in the 13th century; this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I_of_England" title="Henry I of England">Henry I</a> at his hunting lodge in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Oxfordshire" title="Woodstock, Oxfordshire">Woodstock, Oxfordshire</a>, where according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury" title="William of Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> lions had been stocked.
</p><p>Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoo" title="London Zoo">London Zoo</a> until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s. Further changes took place in the early 20th century when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Hagenbeck" title="Carl Hagenbeck">Carl Hagenbeck</a>
 designed enclosures with concrete "rocks", more open space and a moat 
instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck 
designed lion enclosures for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Zoo" title="Melbourne Zoo">Melbourne Zoo</a> and Sydney's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taronga_Zoo" title="Taronga Zoo">Taronga Zoo</a>; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s.
 In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use 
of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors
 to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the 
Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Zoo_and_Botanical_Garden" title="Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden">Oklahoma City Zoological Park</a> placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.

Martin composed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime" title="Pantomime">pantomime</a> titled <i>Les Lions de Mysore</i> ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism" title="Equestrianism">equestrianism</a>
 acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public 
consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. In demonstrating 
the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose 
similar to animal fights of previous centuries.
 The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is 
demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth. The
 now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Beatty" title="Clyde Beatty">Clyde Beatty</a> (1903–1965).

Bas-relief of a wounded lioness from Nineveh, c. 645–635 BC

<p>Lion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal 
pastime; intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. The 
earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_III" title="Amenhotep III">Amenhotep&nbsp;III</a> killing 102 lions "with his own arrows" during the first ten years of his rule. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria" title="Assyria">Assyrians</a>
 would release captive lions in a reserved space for the king to hunt; 
this event would be watched by spectators as the king and his men, on 
horseback or chariots, killed the lions with arrows and spears. Lions 
were also hunted during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" title="Mughal Empire">Mughal Empire</a>, where Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir" title="Jahangir">Jahangir</a> is said to have excelled at it. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Rome</a>, lions were kept by emperors for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venatio" title="Venatio">hunts</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestiarii" class="mw-redirect" title="Bestiarii">gladiator fights</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_ad_bestias" title="Damnatio ad bestias">executions</a>.
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_people" title="Maasai people">Maasai people</a>
 have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. 
Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced 
lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa" title="Scramble for Africa">European colonisation of Africa</a> in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered as vermin and lion hides fetched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">£1</a> each. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_hunting" title="Trophy hunting">Trophy hunting</a> of lions in recent years has been met with controversy; notably with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Cecil_the_lion" title="Killing of Cecil the lion">killing of Cecil the lion</a> in mid-2015.

The Tsavo maneaters of East Africa on display in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago

<p>Lions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them out. One well-publicised case is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_maneaters" class="mw-redirect" title="Tsavo maneaters">Tsavo maneaters</a>; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Railway" title="Uganda Railway">Kenya-Uganda Railway</a> were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge in Kenya.
 The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' 
predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and 
one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including 
tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth 
and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while 
tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in 
human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on 
humans. Sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.
</p><p>Lions' proclivity for man-eating has been systematically 
examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating 
behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 
2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this 
period. The incidents occurred near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selous_Game_Reserve" title="Selous Game Reserve">Selous National Park</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufiji_River" title="Rufiji River">Rufiji District</a> and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindi_Region" title="Lindi Region">Lindi Province</a>
 near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villages into bush 
country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must 
mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes 
directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which lions seize humans 
from the centres of substantial villages have been documented. Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon" title="Full moon">full moon</a>, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.
</p><p>According to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly 
crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and 
eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. 
Frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>
 sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. For 
nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly
 crossed the park in daytime with little harm.

<p>The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human
 culture. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, 
on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.
 It appeared as a symbol for strength and nobility in cultures across 
Europe, Asia and Africa, despite incidents of attacks on people. The 
lion has been depicted as "king of the jungle" and "king of beasts", and
 thus became a popular symbol for royalty and stateliness. The lion is also used as a symbol of sporting teams.

<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, the lion has been a common character in stories, proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts. In some cultures, the lion symbolises power and royalty. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili language</a>, the lion is known as <i>simba</i> which also means "aggressive", "king" and "strong".

 kingdom is said to have been raised by lions and returned to his people
 part-lion to unite them using the knowledge he learned from the lions.
</p><p>In parts of West Africa, lions symbolised the top class of their social hierarchies. In more heavily forested areas where lions were rare, the leopard represented the top of the hierarchy. In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and is regarded as the link between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairvoyance" title="Clairvoyance">seers</a> and the supernatural. In other East African traditions, the lion is the symbol of laziness.In much of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_folklore" class="mw-redirect" title="African folklore">African folklore</a>, the lion is portrayed as having low intelligence and is easily tricked by other animals.
</p><p>The ancient Egyptians portrayed several of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_deities" title="List of war deities">war deities</a> as lionesses, which they revered as fierce hunters.
